# Single-Cycle-Processor
This is a single-cycle processor, meaning each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.

The processor implements the SimpleRisc ISA, which supports:

21 operations

16 general-purpose registers, each 32 bits wide

Architecture
The processor operates in five stages, which are described in detail in the documentation.

A complete circuit diagram of the processor is provided below.
